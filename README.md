# StellarWarpProject
This is my first project related to data analysis. It analyzes my gacha data from the game Honkai Star Rail (https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/).
NOTE: Every feature done in my project can be done through the Star Rail Station website (https://starrailstation.com/en/warp#char_event), which has much more features and visualizations than my small project.

If you are still interested in using my project and get some results, follow the steps below:
1. Go to https://starrailstation.com/en/warp#char_event and follow its instructions to import your warp history.
2. Click the 'System' icon next to 'Import' button, then choose 'Export to Excel'. The downloaded file should be named as 'starrailstation-warp-data.xlsx'. If not, rename it.
3. Put it in the 'data' folder. (Yes you have to overwrite the current .xlsx file which is mine)
4. Run the .ipynb and you should be able to see the results. Jupyter Notebook is recommended.
